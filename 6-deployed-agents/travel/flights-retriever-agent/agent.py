Agent information:
---
Mainly relies on https://rapidapi.com/apiheya/api/sky-scrapper.

We should switch to another API that better fits our needs.
We can not filter as much as we should, therefore the request takes longer and we have to filtered in here.
Inefficient and a hogwash.

Missing:
- A plain basic 'limit' query param (it is in v2 but just not working)
- Filter by 'stops'
- Request round-trips (not a big deal).
