## Overview

This project consists of two main components:
1. **Stripe Payment Agent**: Handles payment link generation and processes Stripe webhook events.
2. **User Agent**: Interacts with the Stripe Payment Agent to create payment links and generate invoices.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for exposing local servers to the internet

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd fetch-stripe-payment-agent
    ```

2. Install dependencies using Poetry:
    ```sh
    poetry install
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
    ```env
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<your-stripe-secret-key>
    STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<your-stripe-webhook-secret>
    OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
    ```

## Usage

### Running the Agents

1. Start the Bureau to run both the Stripe Payment Agent and the User Agent:
    ```sh
    poetry run python run_agents.py
    ```

2. Expose the local server using ngrok:
    ```sh
    ngrok http 8000
    ```

3. Update your Stripe webhook settings to point to the ngrok URL (e.g., `https://<ngrok-id>.ngrok.io/webhook`).

### Running the Flask Server for Webhooks

1. Start the Flask server for handling Stripe webhooks:
    ```sh
    poetry run python webhook.py
    ```

### Creating a Payment Link

You can create a payment link by sending a POST request to the User Agent's `/create_payment` endpoint. Here is an example using `curl`:

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/create_payment \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "amount": 100.0,
           "product_name": "Sample Product",
           "quantity": 1,
           "email": "customer@example.com",
           "name": "Customer Name"
         }'
```
