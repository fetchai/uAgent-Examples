# Health & Wellness Q&A System with Prem.ai

This project is a simple health and wellness Q&A system powered by **Prem.ai** and the **uAgents** framework. It allows users to ask health-related questions and receive responses generated by a pre-configured AI model.

---

## Introduction

This example demonstrates how to use **Prem.ai** as a backend for building a conversational AI agent system. The project integrates the **uAgents** framework to handle interactions between the user and the AI model. By using Prem.ai's Lab and Launchpad, you can experiment with various models and customize them for your use case.

## Setup Guide

### Step 1: Create a Prem.ai Account

1. Activate your Prem.ai account by [signing up here](https://app.premai.io/accounts/signup/).
2. Sign in to your account and generate an **API Key**:
   - Navigate to the "Settings" or "API Keys" section.
   - Copy the API Key for use in your application.

### Step 2: Create a New Project

1. Navigate to the "Projects" page in Prem.ai.
2. Create a new project or use the starter project provided by Prem.ai.
3. **Take note of the Project ID**, which youâ€™ll find under the project title or on the Setup page.

### Step 3: Experiment with Prem.ai

1. Visit the **Lab** to experiment with various AI models simultaneously.
2. Use the **Launchpad** to deploy the most suitable model for your use case.
3. Note the Repository ID for the model configuration.

## Environment Variables

The application requires the following environment variables to be set:

- `REPO_ID`: Repository ID of your AI model in Prem.ai.
- `PROJECT_ID`: Project ID of your Prem.ai project.
- `API_KEY`: API key for authenticating requests to Prem.ai.

You can set these variables in your environment or in a `.env` file for local development.
