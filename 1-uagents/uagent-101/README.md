# uAgents Examples

Welcome to uAgents Examples!
The examples are divided into two categories: Agent Core and Network. 

- **Agent Core**: This category includes the main functionalities of uAgents, such as intervals, storage, protocols, and messages.
- **Network**: This category covers functionalities like bureau, mailbox, remote agents, and name service.

For more information on these concepts, please visit our [documentation](https://fetch.ai/docs/guides/agents/create-a-uagent)

You can also directly navigate to either the `agent-core` or `network` folder and start experimenting with uAgents. Each example includes a README file explaining the main concepts and how to run the agent. Feel free to play around with the code!

Agent Core examples are compatible with our Agentverse Command Line tool, [AVCTL](https://fetch.ai/docs/guides/avctl/avctl), so you can deploy your local agents to [Agentverse](https://fetch.ai/docs/guides/agentverse/creating-a-hosted-agent).
