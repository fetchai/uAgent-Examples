# Web3 Project

This project showcases the integration of the Web3.py library with uAgents to interact with Ethereum smart contracts and manage agent systems. The example highlights initiating a USDC transfer, processing the transaction, and verifying the transaction status through a agent system. This includes demonstrating how uAgents can be used to facilitate token transfers to smart contracts and send funds seamlessly
